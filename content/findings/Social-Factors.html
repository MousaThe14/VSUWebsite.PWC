<p>While this page is <em>optional</em>, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:</p>
<div id="main-findings" class="section level3">
<h3>Main Findings</h3>
<div id="food-access" class="section level4">
<h4>Food Access</h4>
<p>According to EcoDistricts (2016), a food desert is a community where more than 20 percent of residents are living below the poverty threshold and at least 33 percent of the population lives more than a mile from a supermarket.</p>
</div>
<div id="pollution" class="section level4">
<h4>Pollution</h4>
<p>Pollution is found to have multiple ties to major health issues. It can serve as an indicator for later in life chronic issues such as heart and respiratory diseases.
<br>
Air pollution has been shown to have negative impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health regardless of short term or chronic exposure.
<br>
Long term exposure has been shown to have links to diabetes.
Specifically, traffic-related air pollution has been shown as a risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes.</p>

<div id="poverty" class="section level4">
<h4>Poverty</h4>

<div id="conclusion-and-policy-implications" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion and Policy Implications</h3>
<p>[Here you could highlight the main takeaways and the potential policy implications of your findings.]</p>
</div>
<div id="references" class="section level3">
<h3>References</h3>
<p>[List your references here using APA format (or at least standardize all of the references using the same format).]</p>
